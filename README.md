## Purpose of Sprint
- Widen the pool of open-source contributors
- Contribute to NumPy library
- Involve more women and gender minorities in NumPy and open source
- Build momentum for continued contribution


## Goals for the Day
- The plan is to work in pairs/small groups. 
- The goal is that each participant will be able to resolve one fix and submit a pull request (PR).

## Community Announcements

### Support Open Source
- There is no charge for the sprint. We ask you to donate a nominal amount ($5 to $10) [to NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org/donate) to support open source.
  - For "Donation Dedication:"  indicate "NumPy"
  - For "Please notify the following person that a donation has been made:" indicate "berlin@wimlds.org"

### Women's Space
We welcome all genders.  We also ask our attendees to respect that this organization and event is a women's space.  One example of creating that space is allowing women to speak and ask questions.

## Preparation

### 1.  GitHub Account
- Open an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- [Git should be installed](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- Some familiarity with Git / GitHub 
- Prior to event, review some [Git resources](https://github.com/reshamas/git-intro-workshop/blob/master/extra_resources/resource_git_tutorials.md) 
- We will go over pull requests at beginning of event

### 2.  Join [Discord](https://discord.com/) and [Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-de/)
Discord is a voice, text and video communication platform that allows us to set both text and voice channels.
We are using the [Mentored Sprints](https://www.mentored-sprints.dev/) Server on Discord for the sprint to help mentors support participants and enable us to pair program. 
Participants will be invited to join and connect via the Discord Server during the pre-sprint setup.

A beginners guide to discord can be found here(https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045138571-Beginner-s-Guide-to-Discord)

Join the WiMLDS community and NumPy on Slack
Participants will be invited and encouraged to join both WiMLDS and NumPy on Slack for continued support. See links above under the heading *post-sprint.

### 3.  Read through [NumPy Contributing documentation](https://numpy.org/devdocs/dev/index.html#development-process-summary)
These steps will be covered at the pre-sprint set up (May 4th 7pm CET).  
* It is approx a 30 min read
* The following documentation will help you setup and build a local development environment:
- [Fork copy of NumPy repository](https://numpy.org/devdocs/dev/gitwash/development_setup.html#forking)
- [Configure git for NumPy Development](https://numpy.org/devdocs/dev/gitwash/development_setup.html)
* There is an alternative option to use the numpy gitpod setup.  More information can be found [here](https://numpy.org/devdocs/dev/development_gitpod.html)

* General guidelines for contributing:
- Contributor guidelines https://numpy.org/devdocs/dev/index.html
- Read through the recommended [development workflow](https://numpy.org/devdocs/dev/development_workflow.html)
- Read through how-to [guide to contributing to NumPy documentation](https://numpy.org/devdocs/dev/howto-docs.html)



### 4.  Review [Open Issues](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues) 
* [NumPy repository](https://github.com/numpy/numpy)
* There are over 2000 issues :sweat:
* For the sprint, it is recommended to pick issues found in the middle of the issues stack
	- old issues are often difficult to solve or unresolvable which is why they still remain
	- very new issues are often taken up very quickly and so someone is likely to already be contributing to them
* Take a look through the issues and become familiar with them 

### 5.  Curated List of Issues
- A list of documentation issues was highlighted by the mentors during the sprint. You can find it [here](https://hackmd.io/8fVV6kztR2WBQZRvoCRK9Q?both) along with other useful tips on how to submit a commit and ultimate PR.
- A sub-set of issues were labelled with sprint-wimlds on the numpy git-repo [here](https://github.com/numpy/numpy.org/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Asprint-wimlds).

## Get Sprinting! (aka fixing Issues and submitting a PR!)
Here are a few more useful links and guides to follow:
### Documentation Issues
If you are working on documentation, remember to check against https://numpy.org/devdocs - this is the version of the documentation corresponding to the latest development version (aka what is merged on the main branch on github). The https://numpy.org/doc/stable version might be outdated (corresponds to the latest release).

### How to Co-author commits
If you worked in a pair/group and want to know how to acknowledge multiple authors on the PR.  Find some helpful documentation [here](https://gist.github.com/lisawolderiksen/f9747a3ae1e58e9daa7d176ab98f1bad)

### Labelling commit messages
Commit messages should be clear and follow a few basic rules. Please try to label your commits with an indicative label.  A guide to best practice can be found [here](https://numpy.org/devdocs/dev/development_workflow.html?highlight=commit message#writing-the-commit-message)
