## Preparation

### 1.  GitHub Account
- Open an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- [Git should be installed](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- Some familiarity with Git / GitHub 
- Prior to event, review some [Git resources](https://github.com/reshamas/git-intro-workshop/blob/master/extra_resources/resource_git_tutorials.md) 
- We will go over pull requests at beginning of event

### 2.  Join [Discord](https://discord.com/) and [Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-de/)
Discord is a voice, text and video communication platform that allows us to set both text and voice channels.
We have created a private server on Discord for the sprint to help mentors support participants and enable us to pair program. 
Participants will be invited to join and connect via the Discord Server during the pre-sprint setup.

Join the WiMLDS community and NumPy on Slack
Participants will be invited and encouraged to join both WiMLDS and NumPy on Slack for continued support.

### 3.  Read through [NumPy Contributing documentation](https://numpy.org/devdocs/dev/index.html#development-process-summary)
These steps will be covered at the pre-sprint set up (May 4th 7pm CET).  
* It is approx a 30 min read
- [Fork copy of NumPy repository](https://numpy.org/devdocs/dev/gitwash/development_setup.html#forking)
- [Configure git for NumPy Development](https://numpy.org/devdocs/dev/gitwash/development_setup.html)
- Read through the recommended [development workflow](https://numpy.org/devdocs/dev/development_workflow.html)
- Read through how-to [guide to contributing to NumPy documentation](https://numpy.org/devdocs/dev/howto-docs.html)

### 4.  Review [Open Issues](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues) 
* [NumPy repository](https://github.com/numpy/numpy)
* There are over 2000 issues :sweat:
* For the sprint, it is recommended to pick issues found in the middle of the issues stack
	- old issues are often difficult to solve or unresolvable which is why they still remain
	- very new issues are often taken up very quickly and so someone is likely to already be contributing to them
* Take a look through the issues and become familiar with them 

### 5.  Curated List of Issues
- A list of beginner/sprint friendly issues will be highlighted by the mentors during the sprint or pre-sprint event.
